This project's I/O is mostly the same as the code for the clean system. Before the Monte Carlo algorithm is run, "GenerateDisorder.jl" generates a fixed disorder realization. For a disorder strength Delta in (0, 1), this realization consists of a bond-strength multiplier uniformly distributed between (1 - Delta) and (1 + Delta) for every nearest-neighbor bond on the lattice.  The array of multipliers is saved as a JLD file named "Realization.jld", which is read in by "main.jl" at runtime.
